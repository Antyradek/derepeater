Finds and prints parts of the text with repeated words in gadzillion colours.
Full support for Unicode charset.
This is really useful in storywriting.

The program does not work on the whole words, which means it can find the same word in different varietes.
"Plazma plazmował plazmową plazmatyczność."
Will mark all of these words as duplicates.
"Responsible irresponsibility"
Will mark parts of those too.

You will need a terminal which understands ANSI escape codes.
Best results are on modern terminals supporting 24-bit colours, but dumb ones are also supported.
Tested under: Konsole, Xterm, Terminator.

See manual and --help for detailed usage info.
The simplest way to run it, is to give only filename as argument.
